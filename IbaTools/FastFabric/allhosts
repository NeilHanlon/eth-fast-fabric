# [ICS VERSION STRING: unknown]
# This file lists the TCP/IP names of ALL the hosts in the cluster.
# THIS SHOULD INCLUDE THE NODE RUNNING FASTFABRIC
#
# Each line may specify a single host, a comment or another host list file to
# include. You can augment a hostname with a list of network interfaces to
# specify the interfaces join the fabric. For example,
#   host1:eth2,eth3
# If no network interfaces defined for a host, all available interfaces on the
# host will be considered as part of the fabric.
# A host shall appear only in one line. If there are multiple occurrences,
# FastFabric will use the last one.
#
# This file will be used by FastFabric to indicate which hosts should be
# operated on by various fastfabric menus and CLI commands.

include /etc/eth-tools/hosts
# add line below with TCP/IP name of FastFabric host (eg. this host)
