Intel Ethernet tools and Fast Fabric
-------------------------

* To build the RPM and SRPM:

  1. mkdir -p $HOME/rpmbuild/{SOURCES,RPMS,SRPMS}
  2. cp eth-tools.spec.in eth-tools.spec
  3. ./update_eth_spec.sh
  4. name="eth-fast-fabric-$(grep '^Version:' eth-tools.spec.in |cut -d' ' -f2 |sed 's/~/-/g')" && tar czf $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES/$name.tar.gz --exclude-vcs --transform "s,^,$name/," .
  5. rpmbuild -ba ./eth-tools.spec

  This will build the eth-tools-basic and eth-tools-fastfabric RPMS
  in $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/(architecture)/

  This will also create a eth-tools-debuginfo RPM, which by default contains basic symbol
  information - see below on how to build with full debugging information.

* How to include debugging symbols:

  export BUILD_CONFIG=debug

  prior to the aforementioned build procedure.
